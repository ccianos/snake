# Snake Game in Go

This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game in Go. The game is played in the terminal and uses keyboard input to control the snake's direction. 

## How to Play

- Use the arrow keys to control the direction of the snake.
- The snake will continue to move in its current direction even if no key is pressed.
- Eat the food (represented by 'X') to grow the snake and increase your score.
- Avoid running into the walls or the snake's own body.

## Controls

- `Up Arrow` - Move up
- `Down Arrow` - Move down
- `Left Arrow` - Move left
- `Right Arrow` - Move right
- `Esc` or `q` - Quit the game
